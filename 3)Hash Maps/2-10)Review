Review
    Now that we have all of the functionality of a hash map, it’s time to review what we’ve learned. Use what you know about hash maps to track birds for New York’s annual bird census.

Instructions
    1.
    Create a HashMap, birdCensus in our .main() method. We’ll use the hash map data structure to store all bird sightings. Give it an array size of 15.

    2.
    It’s essential for our census that we know the type of bird seen and the location where it was spotted.

    Assign the following key-value pairs to birdCensus:
        - Key: "mandarin duck", Value: "Central Park Pond"
        - Key: "monk parakeet", Value: "Brooklyn College"
        - Key: "horned owl", Value: "Pelham Bay Park"

    3.
    Retrieve the location for each of the three birds counted in birdCensus. Print them to the terminal.

    Congratulations, you implemented a fully-functional hash map! Some things to consider:
        : How would you delete a key-value pair from this hash map?
        : Are there any other ways of handling collisions besides separate chaining? What would be the advantages or disadvantages of a method of avoiding separate chaining?
