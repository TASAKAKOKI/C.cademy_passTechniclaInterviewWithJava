Introduction
    In this lesson, you will learn how to implement the merge sort algorithm in Java. You can think of the algorithm as having two separate functional steps:
        : "Splitting" – The algorithm "recursively splits the input array until each element is in its own array". An example is represented in the top half of the image to the right.
        : "Merging" – The algorithm "compares and combines the elements of arrays until the input array is sorted". This is shown in the bottom half of the image.

    We’ll start in the next exercise with splitting the input array.
