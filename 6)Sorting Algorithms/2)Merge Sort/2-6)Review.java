Review
    Nice work building your own sort() function. An important point to "remember about merge sort is that the algorithm is broken into two parts: splitting and merging". Regardless of the order or length (including odd or even lengths) of your input array, the "algorithm will always split the elements into their own arrays first, and then combine them into a sorted array". This fact makes the average, best, and worst case complexities all equal to the same value, "O(n log n)".

    This time complexity makes "merge sort one of the most efficient and popular sorting algorithms". Take a look at merge sort compared to a few others on toptal.com.

Instructions
    In MergeSort.java, we included your code from the last exercise. If youâ€™re up for the challenge, see if you can combine the two lines in your if and else blocks into one line to make your code look a little cleaner.
