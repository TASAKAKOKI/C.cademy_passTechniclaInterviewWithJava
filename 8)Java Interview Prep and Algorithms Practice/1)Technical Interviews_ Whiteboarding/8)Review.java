Review
    Technical interviews judge the candidateâ€™s ability to perform technical aspects of the job. "Whiteboarding" is a type of technical interview which "requires the candidate to code a solution without the assistance of a text editor".

    Coding an efficient solution is important, but the ultimate goal as an interviewee is to "convince the interviewer you would be a desirable co-worker".

    A "desirable co-worker" is "able to articulate their thought process and collaborate without friction".

    Our whiteboarding strategies revolve around communication at every step.

    The steps are:
        1. Clarify the Problem
        2. Create Inputs
        3. Outline the Solution
        4. Code the Solution
        5. Test the Solution
        6. Analyze the Solution

    Practice makes perfect!

    Run through these steps with a new practice problem:
        Write a function which prints every number from 0 up to the given input. If divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. If divisible by 5, print "Buzz". If input is divisible by 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz".
