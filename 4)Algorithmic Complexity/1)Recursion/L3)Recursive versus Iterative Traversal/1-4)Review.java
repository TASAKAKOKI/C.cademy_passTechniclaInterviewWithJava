Review
    In this lesson, you learned how to implement a recursive solution to a linked list search. The solution includes the following cases:
        : Base case 1 – return null if the end of the linked list is reached.
        : Base case 2 – return the current node if its data value matches the data argument.
        : Recursive Case – return a call to findNodeRecursively() with the next node as an argument.
        
    The recursive approach laid out in this lesson is similar to implementations for traversing other data structures, like trees and directories. This is an important insight to keep in mind as you encounter more recursive implementations.

Instructions
    Nice work completing this lesson. Recursion is tough! Don’t worry if you struggle to implement recursion solutions going forward. The more exposure you have to the concept, the easier it will become.
