Review
    Throughout this lesson, you learned about recursion as you coded a factorial method. While every recursive problem is a little different, the following features will always be required:
        : "Recursive case" – the conditions under which the method will perform an action and call itself.
        : "Base case" – the conditions under which the method returns a value without making any additional calls to itself.
        
    In this example, we started by considering the recursive case. With some problems it may be easier to start with the base case. Regardless, when you are dealing with a recursive problem, start by thinking about potential recursive and base cases for your solution.

    In Factorial.java, to the right, we included both the iterative and recursive solutions to factorial. Both approaches work equally well for this problem.

    As you learn more about recursion, you may find recursive syntax to be more readable and easier to understand when addressing certain problems. Consider it another tool in your toolbox as you approach increasingly challenging programming problems.

Instructions
    1.
    Change the main method so the program prints the following:

        The recursive solution to 10! is: 3628800
        The iterative solution to 10! is: 3628800
    Make sure you change the value of the argument passed to each method, and the number in the logged string.
