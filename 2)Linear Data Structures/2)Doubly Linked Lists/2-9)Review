Review
    Congratulations, you have implemented a doubly linked list class in Java!
    We did this by:
        - Using our Node class to hold the data and links between nodes
        - Implementing a DoublyLinkedList class to handle external operations on the list, like adding and removing nodes
        - Creating an instance of our list, and using the .printList() method to track the changes we made

Instructions
    Feel free to play around a bit with your code. Here are some ideas:
        - Create a few nodes and add them to both ends of a new doubly linked list
        - Print your doubly linked list out using your .printList() method
        - Remove your doubly linked list’s head or tail node
        - Print your list again — were the right nodes removed?
        - Remove a specific node from somewhere in the middle of the list, then print the list again. Did it work?
        - We created our .removeByData() method by iterating from the head of the list to the tail. Do you think you could start at the tail and iterate backward? Try it!
