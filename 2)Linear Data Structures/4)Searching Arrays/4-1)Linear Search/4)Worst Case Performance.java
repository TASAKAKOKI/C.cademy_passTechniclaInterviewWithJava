Worst Case Performance
    There are two worst cases for linear search.
        Case 1: when the target value at the end of the list.alt
        Case 2: when the target value does not exist in the list.alt
    In both cases, the linear search algorithm is required to scan the entire list of N elements and, therefore, makes N comparisons.

    For this reason, the time complexity for linear search in its worst case is O(N)
