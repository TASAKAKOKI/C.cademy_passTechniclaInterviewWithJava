Implementation
    You finished your LinkedList class! Now we’re going to create an instance of that class and create a linked list of the seasons. We will add to it, remove from it, and finally print it out to see what we’ve done.

Instructions
    1.
    In the main method, define a LinkedList named seasons. Print it out using your .printList() method. What do you expect to see?
    
    2.
    Add "summer" to the head of seasons. Then add "spring" to the head and print the list again.

    3.
    Add "fall" to the tail of the seasons. Then add "winter" to the tail and print the list again.

    4.
    Finally, remove the element at the head of the list. Print the list to check that the correct element was removed.
