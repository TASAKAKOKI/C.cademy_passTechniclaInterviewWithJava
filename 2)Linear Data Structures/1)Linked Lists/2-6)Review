Review
    Congratulations, you just implemented a linked list class in Java!
    We did this by:
        Using our Node class’s data and next properties
        Implementing a LinkedList class to handle external operations on the list, like adding and removing nodes
        Creating an instance of our list, and using our .printList() method to track the changes we made
        
Instructions
    1.
    Feel free to play around a bit with your code. Here are some ideas:
        Create a few nodes and add them to both ends of a new linked list
        Print your linked list out using your .printList() method
        Remove your linked list’s head node
        Print your list again — was your original head node removed?
        So far you’ve built a method to remove the head of the list. How do you think you would remove a node that has a specific data?
