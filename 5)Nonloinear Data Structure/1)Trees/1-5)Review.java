Tree Review
    "Trees" are 'useful for modeling data that has a hierarchical relationship' which moves in the direction from parent to child. 'No child node will have more than one parent'.

    To recap some terms:
        - "root": A node which has no parent. "One per tree".
        - "parent": A node "which references other nodes".
        - "child": Nodes "referenced by other nodes".
        - "sibling": Nodes "which have the same parent".
        - "leaf": Nodes "which have no children".
        - "level": The "height or depth of the tree". Root nodes are at level 1, their children are at level 2, and so on.

Instructions
    That was a lot of theory! "Trees are beneficial" and "youâ€™ll find they come up all the time as a useful way of modeling hierarchical data".
