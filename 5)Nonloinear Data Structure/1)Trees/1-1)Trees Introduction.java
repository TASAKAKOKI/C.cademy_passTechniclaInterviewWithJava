Trees Introduction
    "Trees" are an 'essential data structure for storing hierarchical data with a directed flow'.

    Similar to linked lists and graphs, trees are "composed of nodes which hold data". The diagram represents nodes as rectangles and data as text.

    Nodes also store references to zero or more other tree nodes. 'Data moves down from node to node'. We depict those references as lines drawn between rectangles.

    Trees are "often displayed with a single node at the top and connected nodes branching downwards".

Instructions    
    A company’s organization chart or a computer’s file directory are both real-world examples that can be represented as trees.

    Can you think of other hierarchical relationships?

    How would you represent a genealogy chart?
